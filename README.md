## ðŸ“•Rules/How to PlayðŸ“•
Blackjack is a popular casino game. The goal is to win money by getting closest to 21 without going over. At the start of your turn, you place a bet of however much you want and then get dealt one card face up and one card face down. You may then choose to either hit or stay. Hitting draws one more card, and staying keeps your current cards. If you ever go over 21, it is considered a bust and you automatically lose. After you stay, the dealer will continuously draw cards until they either beat you or bust. If the dealer busts, you win and double your bet! If the dealer gets a higher score than you, then you lose your bet.

Card Values:
  Ace = 1 or 11,
  King = 10,
  Queen = 10,
  Jack = 10,
  All number cards are their respective values.
